### Hi I just wanted to let you know that this will actually count all N's and include the N's in the fasta headers. You should also count the # of N's in the headers and subtract that from your value to get the actual number of N's. 

```
grep '^>' dmel-all-chromosome-r6.24.fasta | grep -o 'N' | wc -l
```
